# Valentine's Day Game: Cat & Bombs

A fun and interactive game where you control a cute cat and try to dodge falling bombs. The game is built with React, and it's perfect for a fun Valentine's Day theme.

## Features

- Control the cat using arrow keys.
- Bombs fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds and intervals.
- The game ends if the cat collides with a bomb.
- A "Will you be my Valentine?" message appears at the top left, and "bomb = yes" at the top right.
- You can restart the game after a collision.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework to build the interactive interface.
